# 🐉 DanMachi DnD Combat Simulator

**DanMachi DnD Combat Simulator** is a Python-based combat simulation framework tailored for Dungeons & Dragons (5e) inspired gameplay, specifically integrating elements from the DanMachi universe. The system is meant for resolving single-instance combat scenarios.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project aims to create a comprehensive and accurate combat simulation system that combines the tactical depth of D&D 5e mechanics with the rich fantasy world of DanMachi (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?). Key objectives include:

### Core Gameplay Goals
- **Tactical Combat System**: Implement authentic D&D 5e combat mechanics including turn-based action economy, attack rolls, damage calculations, and saving throws
- **Status Effect Mastery**: Create a robust effect system that properly handles buffs, debuffs, and incapacitating effects with accurate duration tracking and mechanical impact
- **Intelligent AI Opposition**: Develop smart NPC behavior that provides challenging and engaging combat encounters

### DanMachi Universe Integration
- **Authentic World Building**: Incorporate DanMachi creatures, characters, and lore into a mechanically sound D&D framework
- **Dungeon Floor Progression**: Feature enemies and challenges representative of different dungeon floors (F1-F10 and beyond)

### Technical Excellence
- **Modular Architecture**: Maintain clean, extensible code structure that supports easy addition of new content and mechanics
- **Data-Driven Design**: Utilize JSON configuration files for flexible content management and easy customization
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure all game mechanics work exactly as intended, from basic attacks to complex spell interactions

The ultimate goal is to provide a simulation platform where players can experience tactical D&D combat within the DanMachi universe, complete with proper mechanical depth.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Recommended: virtual environment (venv)

### 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galfurian/danmachi_dnd_combat_simulator.git
cd danmachi_dnd_combat_simulator
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚔️ Running the Simulator

Start the simulator from the `simulator` folder:

```bash
python main.py
```

The **DnD Combat Simulator** provides:

- Tactical combat encounter against intelligent NPCs.
- Spell casting, attack mechanics, and effect handling.
- Clear, interactive command-line interface (CLI).

---

## 📁 Data Structure

All entities and actions are stored as JSON files within the `data` directory:

- **player.json**: Player character definitions.
- **actions.json**: General action definitions.
- **enemies_danmachi_f1_f10.json**: Enemies from DanMachi floors 1-10.
- Other JSON files: Classes, races, armors, spells, and more.
