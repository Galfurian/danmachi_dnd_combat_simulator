    """
    Buff abilities that provide beneficial effects to targets.

    BuffAbility represents beneficial special powers like Bardic Inspiration,
    Guidance, Bless, and other enhancement abilities. These abilities apply
    positive effects to allies without dealing damage.

    Key Features:
        - No damage components (pure effect application)
        - Always beneficial effects on willing targets
        - Duration-based enhancements
        - Multi-target support through target expressions
        - Concentration requirements for some abilities

    Effect System:
        - Mandatory effect parameter (buffs must provide benefits)
        - Effect duration management
        - Stacking rules handled by effect system
        - Concentration tracking for long-duration buffs

    Usage Examples:
        - Bardic Inspiration (bonus dice to rolls)
        - Guidance (advantage on ability checks)
        - Bless (attack and save bonuses)
        - Heroism (temporary hit points and immunity to fear)
        - Haste (extra actions and movement)

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create a bardic inspiration ability
        inspiration = BuffAbility(
            name="Bardic Inspiration",
            type=ActionType.BONUS,
            description="Inspire an ally with words of encouragement",
            cooldown=0,
            maximum_uses=3,  # Based on Charisma modifier
            effect=inspiration_effect,  # Provides bonus d6 to rolls
