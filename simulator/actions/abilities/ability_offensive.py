    """
    Offensive abilities that deal damage to targets.

    OffensiveAbility represents damage-dealing special powers like dragon breath
    weapons, natural attacks, monster abilities, and combat techniques. These
    abilities deal direct damage without requiring attack rolls in most cases.

    Key Features:
        - Direct damage application
        - Multiple damage types and components
        - Critical hit potential (if implemented)
        - Effect application on successful hits
        - Multi-target support through target expressions

    Damage System:
        - Base damage from ability's damage components
        - Bonus damage from effects and modifiers
        - All damage calculated and applied together
        - No attack rolls by default (direct application)

    Usage Examples:
        - Dragon breath weapons
        - Monster special attacks (mind blast, tail sweep)
        - Racial abilities (dragonborn breath, tiefling hellish rebuke)
        - Environmental hazard abilities
        - Activated magic item powers
