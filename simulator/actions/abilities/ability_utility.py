    """
    Utility abilities that provide non-combat benefits.

    UtilityAbility represents non-combat special powers like Detect Magic,
    Misty Step, Investigation abilities, and other utility functions. These
    abilities typically don't deal damage or heal but provide other benefits.

    Key Features:
        - No damage or healing components
        - Utility effects (teleportation, detection, etc.)
        - Information gathering capabilities
        - Environmental interaction
        - Problem-solving applications

    Effect System:
        - Optional effects (some utilities are pure mechanical functions)
        - Informational effects (like revealing information)
        - Movement effects (teleportation, dimension door)
        - Detection effects (magic, poison, traps)

    Usage Examples:
        - Detect Magic (reveals magical auras)
        - Misty Step (short-range teleportation)
        - Thieves' Tools Expertise (improved lock picking)
        - Animal Handling (calm or communicate with animals)
        - Investigation (enhanced searching abilities)
